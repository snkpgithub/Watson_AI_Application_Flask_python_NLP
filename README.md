# Learning Modules

This repository contains structured learning modules covering web applications, APIs, Flask, and Watson AI libraries.

## Web Applications and APIs - Learning Module

### Overview
In this module, you will start with the basic differences between web applications and APIs. Next, you will learn about the application development lifecycle, from gathering requirements to maintaining the project. You will also get familiar with the best practices for coding as documented in the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP8) style guide. You will learn about static code analysis, which is used to ensure that the code you write adheres to coding rules. Next, you will learn how to create and run unit tests. Finally, you will learn how to create, verify, and run Python packages.

### Learning Objectives
- Describe the different phases of the application development lifecycle
- Differentiate between web apps and Application Programming Interface (API)
- Recognize the importance of writing application codes in multiple files
- Outline the Python coding conventions
- Perform static code analysis
- Create and run unit tests
- Create, verify, and execute Python packages

## Python Frameworks and Flask - Learning Module

### Overview
In this module, you will be introduced to the definitions of and key differences between Python libraries and frameworks for application development. You will also learn about Flask, a Python-based micro-framework used for web deployment of applications. The module will also introduce development and deployment concepts, including routes, request and response objects, error handling, and decorators. After building an API with Flask, you will also learn to deploy web apps using Flask.

### Learning Objectives
- Define and differentiate between frameworks and libraries.
- Describe the key features of the Flask web framework and compare it with Django.
- Create and run a Flask application with basic routes in place, explain how to return JSON responses from the server to clients, and describe various configuration options available in Flask.
- Explain the Flask request and response objects.
- Describe how to call an external API in Flask and how to pass parameters to routes in Flask.
- Describe different HTTP statuses that API services can return, explain how error handling works in Flask, and how to return errors from your API endpoints.
- Create and deploy a Python web app using Flask.

## Embeddable Watson AI Libraries - Learning Module

### Overview
In this module, you will be introduced to Embeddable Watson AI libraries. You will also have the opportunity to build two AI-based apps. The practice project will provide you with a challenge to apply your programming skills and incorporate the IBM Watson libraries to build a text-based Sentiment Analysis tool. You will be provided guidance through each step of the project. The final project, Emotion Detection based on text input, will help you get your skills and proficiency assessed by your peers. For both projects, you will perform unit testing, static code analysis, and incorporate error handling.

### Learning Objectives
- Describe the Embeddable Watson AI libraries that can be used to add AI functionality in web apps.
- Apply your Python and Flask coding skills to create, test, and publish web apps integrated with AI functionality.
- Submit your project to peers for assessing your proficiency in building functional web apps with AI functionality.
